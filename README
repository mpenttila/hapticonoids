HAPTICONOIDS - Multi-touch multimodal air hockey
Project for University of Helsinki CS Dept. course Interactive Systems

The project explores localized audio and haptic feedback in an air
hockey game on a large multi-touch screen. Localized feedback is 
provided via players' Android handsets.

See separate READMEs in subdirectories android (Android app) and
