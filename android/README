This is the Android application used in the Hapticonoids haptic feedback test 
project.

Aplication uses Bluetooth to connect the server machine which is running 
a game of Air Hockey. Client selects which players events it will listen 
and then acts upon those events when it receives them.

Currently client supports sound and vibration effects, but it could be 
extended also to support on screen feedback of the game. 

After compilation client should be uploaded to the phone and before running 
phone should be paired with the Bluetooth adapter of the game machine. After
this it will connect automatically to the right feedback server.

Client needs atleast Android 2.2 to work and might have problems with some 
phones containing broken bluetooth stack.
